    <h1>About</h1>
    <p class="about-text">The penguin pond was overcrowded, leaving Baby Penguin hungry and desperate. Spotting Marco the Bear’s pond filled with fish, it waddled over, hoping to snatch a meal. But Marco, towering and unamused, stared in disapproval. Just as tension grew, Tux faced a choice—ignore the struggling baby or intervene. If it ignored the scene, Marco would face no opposition and take over the crowded penguin pond, making life even harder for all penguins. But if the superhero stepped in, it would scoop up Baby Penguin and return it to its kind, ensuring the bear stayed in his place. The question remained—would Baby Penguin get to eat, or would hunger continue to rule its fate?</p>
